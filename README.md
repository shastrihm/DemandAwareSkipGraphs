# Demand Aware Skip Graphs
Python implementation of a skip graphs and skip lists for purely research purposes. Implementations of contraction heuristics and custom visualization tools are included as well.
Some older simulations of self-adjusting skip graph algorithms are available `self_adjusting_SG`, which is what this project started out as. A future thesis student that is interested in this topic could revisit these.

See `static_opt_heuristics.py` for an implementation of our contraction heuristics for the optimal skip graph problem. Including plotting functionality. 

This project contains code that was used in my senior thesis at Reed College, which can be found in `Thesis_Final.pdf`.

Python libraries: Graphviz, PyDot, numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib
