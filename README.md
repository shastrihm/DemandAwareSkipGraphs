# Demand Aware Skip Graphs
Playing around with Demand Aware Skip Graphs.
Some older and unfinished simulations of self-adjusting skip graph algorithms in `self_adjusting_SG`, which is what this project started out as. Might revisit later.

See `static_opt_heuristics.py` for an implementation of our contraction heuristics for the optimal skip graph problem. Including plotting functionality. 


Python libraries: Graphviz, PyDot, numpy, pandas, networkx, matplotlib
