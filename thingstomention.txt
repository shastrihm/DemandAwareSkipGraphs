example after definitions

- route path in skip graph search algorithm is not always the
  shortest path
    - counterexample
    - counterexample to the rebuttal of the
      counterexample: obvious modification to search algorithm (move to node thats "closest" to target)
      isn't always better either

- average (expected) path length. Formally define and motivate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length)


- chapter on NP completeness
    - formulate as decision problems
      - skip graph with shortest path routes vs skip graph with actual routes
        - minimum expected path length problem (mepl - sg)
        - static optimal skip graph problem (sosg)
    - result from paper that proves NPC for grids and any distribution
    - maybe result from paper that proves NPC for minimum linear arrangement and any distribution
    - NPC result for skip graph with shortest path routes MEPL
        - reduction is identity function
            - because we can make a skip graph isomorphic to grid
            - alternative reduction is to make a skip graph isomorphic to a line?

    - NPC for SOSG, for shortest path, open question (cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02935.pdf related work section)
    - optimal substructure not true in finding static optimal skip graph, so no obvious DP alg
    - conjecture that its true for actual skip graph routes (b/c its at elast as hard)
