- route path in skip graph search algorithm is not always the
  shortest path
    - counterexample
    - counterexample to the rebuttal of the
      counterexample: obvious modification to search algorithm (move to node thats "closest" to target)
      isn't always better either

- skip graph route costs are assymetric: i.e. route(u,v) != route(v,u)
  - example

- average (expected) path length. Formally define and motivate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length)


- chapter on NP completeness
    - formulate as decision problems
      - skip graph with shortest path routes vs skip graph with actual routes
        - minimum expected path length problem (mepl - sg)
        - static optimal skip graph problem (sosg)
    - result from paper that proves NPC for grids and any distribution
    - result from paper that proves NPC for minimum linear arrangement (MinLA) and any distribution (input unweighted, directed graph)
        - http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/10578/1/MinLA_Thesis_Seitz.pdf
        - above source mentions NPC for case where input graph is weighted and undirected, but
          directed case is also NPC by a trivial reduction
    - NPC result that shows its NPC to
      find MEPL embedding for a given skip graph topology
      when route costs is either shortest path or actual skip graph search cost
        - reduction is identity function or something similar
            - because we can make a skip graph isomorphic to line
            - alternative reduction is to make a skip graph isomorphic to a grid and use other paper
    - Special cases of MinLA that are still NPC (bipartite graphs) can be extended to request distributions that are bipartite and uniform
    - special case of MEPL - SG = MEPL - BalancedSG is also NP-complete (min cost embedding for Sgs of height log n)
    - cobjecture NPC for SOSG, for shortest path AND skip graph route cost, open question (cite https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02935.pdf related work section)


- static optimal skip graph given any distribution can be found with dynamic programming.
  - however the running time is exponential in the input. (exponential number of subproblems)
  - improvement over brute force, which is factorial, at least
- but can find static optimal skip graph given uniform distribution (i.e. skip graph with minimum average path length)
  - description of construction, intuition (maximizes  connectivity of graph)
  - shortest path between any 2 nodes is = to skip graph routing path (theorem)
  - recurrence relation, closed form for expected path length
  - proof of optimality (among balanced skip graphs, conjectured among all skip graphs)
    - among balanced SGs proof: our construction achieves minimal sum increment at each partitioning/promotion step
      - can extend this proof to prove that finding static optimal skip graph for any demand graph is minimal for balanced skip graphs
- can extend to any distribution that describes clustering behavior (clusters of size a power of 2
   and uniform distribution within clusters)




3/10 meeting
- implement static optimal DP alg, see what best SG is for small n,
    - maybe that will inspire fast alg for finding static optimal SG

- consider LL_u,v, recompute subskipgraph rooted at LL_u,v based on
  subdemand graph (modify demand graph to respect linked list routing,
                  like deleting edges between nodes that are already
                  one hop away in LL_u,v, and maybe multiply demand edges
                  by their pointer distance in LL_u,v, then do the "matching"
                  or some other graph algorithm)

- above alg but by iteratively "collapsing" the modified demand graph

- naive self adjusting strat that respects linked list routing:
    - braid and weave
